I am Shogo Adebayo, a Software Tester, Media Personnel, Graphics Designer, to mention but a few. I have been in the media world for awhile now, but I am currently switching into Tech.

I am also into content creation. I have been passionate about the tech and media world. 

I believe in team work, consistency and organization. I believe nothing is impossible when these three are in place. I am currently volunteering at RCN Theological Seminary- Adullam.
